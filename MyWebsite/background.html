                <p class="indented"> After graduating high school I left for Air Force basic training to be
                    Security Forces.
                    As a Security Forces Patrolman I became experienced in law enforcement and physical security.
                    While this experience is vastly different than what is needed in my target fields I believe there is
                    value in the
                    perspective and experience I gained in that time.</p>
                <blockquote class="callout">During my time in the Air Force I gained a lot of soft skills in
                    addition to my
                    technical
                    training
                    that I believe will benefit me in any profession.</blockquote>

                <p class="indented">My time at UNCW has made me much more well-rounded and gave me a lot of
                    confidence in myself to
                    move
                    forward in life and tackle any problems. Prior to my time in college I lacked experience in
                    complex
                    problem solving and analytical thinking.</p>
                <blockquote class="callout">
                    With my major in Computer Science I have developed problem-solving skills but equally as
                    important the belief in myself that I can learn anything with enough time and effort.
